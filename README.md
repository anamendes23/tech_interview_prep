# Tech Interview Prep

A collection of tech interview questions and answers to be used in mock interview sessions.

## General interview advice

* Listen carefully to the problem statement and ask clarifying questions.
* Make sure to confirm assumptions with your interviewer.
* Talk about edge cases and discuss how they should be handled.
* Propose a solution and discuss the time and space efficiencies.
  - If the interviewer accepts the proposed solution, code it.
  - If you can, try to think of two solutions and compare their cost. Talk about trade-offs.
* Test your code with some test cases - it's ok to fix mistakes that you spot.
* Listen to hints the interviewer gives you. They are there to help you!
* Approch the interview as you are solving a problem with a teammate.
  - It's normal to feel nervous, but it helps to remember the interviewer is there to help you.
